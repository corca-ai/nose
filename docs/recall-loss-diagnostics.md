# Recall-loss diagnostics

`nose verify --recall-loss-report <file>` writes a local JSON report for the
strictness/recall tradeoff in exact semantic matching. It is a diagnostics
artifact, not telemetry: nose does not send it anywhere, and raw source snippets
are omitted by default.

Use this report when a semantic-kernel or semantic-pack change touches exact
admission. The hard rule stays unchanged: stricter admission must not introduce
false merges. The report adds the missing second question: if exact admission got
stricter, what recall did it close and which capability or evidence gap explains
that loss?

## Command

```sh
nose verify <path> --max-violations 0 --recall-loss-report recall-loss.json
```

The command reuses the same interpreter oracle as `nose verify`. The human
stdout remains the existing soundness/completeness report; the JSON artifact is
written only to the requested path.

## Report shape

The current schema is `recall_loss_report.v1.json`:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | Report schema version. Starts at `1`. |
| `privacy` | Local-artifact flags. `remote_collection` is `false`; `raw_source_snippets_included` is `false` by default. |
| `summary` | Total units, interpretable units, excluded units, canon checks, and exact-admission rejection count. |
| `soundness_gate` | Fingerprint groups, false merges, advisory disagreements, canon-preservation violations, `--max-violations`, and gate result. |
| `completeness` | Behavior groups, behavior-equal pairs, fingerprint-equal pairs, completeness percentage, and under-merged groups. |
| `oracle_under_merges` | Behavior-equal but fingerprint-split pairs, sorted by value-Jaccard nearness. This is the structured form of the `--leads` signal. |
| `oracle_exclusions` | Fail-closed oracle exclusions by reason and unit location. |
| `admission_rejections` | Interpretable units whose exact semantic claim is closed, with structured reason, gate, capability, missing evidence, oracle status, and stable location. |
| `by_reason` | Rollups for admission rejections by reason/gate/capability. |
| `top_opportunities` | Ranked under-merge opportunities that future capability work can turn into fixtures or focused follow-up issues. |

The first implementation attributes exact-claim closures to these structured
buckets:

- `strict-exact-unsafe`: the unit is interpretable by the oracle, but the strict
  exact-safety gate keeps it out of the exact semantic claim surface;
- `value-fingerprint-too-small`: the unit is strict-exact-safe, but its value
  fingerprint is below the non-degenerate exact-claim floor.

More specific semantic-kernel gates should add narrower reasons over time, such
as receiver-domain proof, import/symbol proof, library API occurrence proof, HOF
demand/materialization proof, immutable imported snapshot proof, or pack/version
proof. Unknown cases should stay explicit instead of being guessed.

## PR reporting

For any PR that changes exact semantic admission, include this table or the same
fields in prose:

| metric | before | after | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| false merges |  |  | Hard gate: must stay `0` on the selected verification surface. |
| canon-preservation violations |  |  | Hard gate: must stay `0`. |
| completeness percentage |  |  | Soft signal: explain meaningful movement. |
| under-merged behavior groups |  |  | Soft signal: increased misses need attribution. |
| oracle exclusions by reason |  |  | Soft signal: budget/path/uninterpretable growth needs a cause. |
| admission rejections by structured reason |  |  | Main recall-loss signal. |
| top attributed recall-loss bucket |  |  | Name the follow-up capability, fixture, or unsupported boundary. |

Hard gate:

- `false_merges == 0`;
- `canon_preservation_violations == 0`.

Soft regression gate:

- any increase in under-merged groups, oracle exclusions, or admission rejections
  should be attributed to a structured reason bucket;
- intentional fail-closed recall loss should name a follow-up capability,
  fixture, or unsupported boundary;
- recall gains should state which strict evidence or capability made them safe.
